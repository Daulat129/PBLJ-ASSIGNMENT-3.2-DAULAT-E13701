Create Java applications using Spring and Hibernate for dependency injection, CRUD operations, and transaction management.
a. Create a simple Spring application that demonstrates Dependency Injection (DI) using Java-based configuration instead of XML. Define a Student class that depends on a Course class. Use Springâ€™s @Configuration and @Bean annotations to inject dependencies.
b. Develop a Hibernate-based application to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a Student entity using Hibernate ORM with MySQL.
c. Develop a Spring-based application integrated with Hibernate to manage transactions. Create a banking system where users can transfer money between accounts, ensuring transaction consistency.
